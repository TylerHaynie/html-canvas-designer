## About this Project
This is a project of `random ideas` I work on from time to time. Some will be horrible, some will be unfinished. Some might actually be good. 

It's all written in `typescript` because I love strictly typed languages.
Typescript is also very easy to convert to `C#` or `Java`.


### Setting up the project
* Open your terminal of choice and navigate to the root of the project folder.
* Run `npm install` to download all of the required packages. If you don't have `npm` you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
* After all packages are downloaded, you should be able to run `ng serve` in your terminal.  
This will launch a development server and watch for file changes. 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you save any changes made to source while the server is running.


## Ideas

### Css Grid Generator
You may be asking yourself, `"Why? ... Just. why?..."` Well, I was learning about the grid system and I also like randomization. 
So obviously the two should be mixed, right? `It made sense to me at the time.`
I may get creative with it or let mother nature take it back. Only time will tell.

### Designer
I started this project because I wanted to create something from scratch or as close to scratch as I could without using any third-party libraries. 
I sometimes think to myself, `"Well, yeah, It does already exist, but I wonder how I would do it?"`. Then I try to figure it all out.  
I'm a curious person and sometimes I like to see where that will take me. I'm not exactly why I chose to use a canvas, but here we are... 

All the support code for the `Designer` component can be found in `src/app/lib/canvas`
