# Ideas
This is a project of random ideas I work on from time to time.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

First run `npm install` to get all the required packages.

Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
