## About this Project
I started this project because I wanted to create something from scratch or as close to scratch as I could without using any third-party libraries. 
I sometimes think to myself, `"Well, yeah, It does already exist, but I wonder how I would do it?"`. Then I try to figure it all out.  
I'm a curious person and sometimes I like to see where that will take me. I'm not exactly why I chose to use a canvas, but here we are... 

### Setting up the project
* Open your terminal of choice and navigate to the root of the project folder.
* Run `npm install` to download all of the required packages. If you don't have `npm` you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
* After all packages are downloaded, you should be able to run `ng serve` in your terminal.  
This will launch a development server and watch for file changes. 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you save any changes made to source while the server is running.
